====== Export ======

The goal of the export is to transfer all products to the FINDOLOGIC-server, so FINDOLOGIC can index them. To achieve this, there has to be a file or function-call reachable from the outside under ''findologic_export.php'' in the root of the shop.((The path can be changed if necessary))

The export has to be programmed in an OP style to secure simple extensibility without changing the code of the module itself.

===== Parameter of the Export-URL =====

For the sequential processing of the export((due to runtime limitations the export has to be sequential)) the following parameters have to be transmitted: 

  * ''shopkey'': shopkey of the service
  * ''start'': first exported article (Offset) starting with ''0''
  * ''count'': interval-size / how many articles are exported

===== Procedure of the Export =====

The export call delivers [[:fl:modul:direct_integration:xml_schema|valid XML]] for the respective products. The XML also contains the information if more products are delivered, thus FINDOLOGIC can send another call.

  - Call http://www.shop.com/findologic_export.php?shopkey=1234&start=0&count=100 from the FINDOLOGIC-import
  - Return of the XML for the first 100 products (including the information that there will be more)
  - Call http://www.shop.com/findologic_export.php?shopkey=1234&start=100&count=100 from the FINDOLOGIC-import
  - Return of the XML for the next 100 products (including the information that there will be more)
  - Call http://www.shop.com/findologic_export.php?shopkey=1234&start=200&count=100 from the FINDOLOGIC-import
  - More calls ...
  - Return of the last export-page (''total'' number of products is exported)
  - Indexing of all products

===== Products that may not be exported =====
Articles, variants and categories have - depending on the shopsystem - different possibilities to be excluded from beeing shown in the webshop (= invisible).

Typical possibilities are: 
  * Stock (has to be >0)
  * Sale (if active stock may be <0)
  * Active / Inactive (only active products are exported)
  * Show / Hide (only shown products are exported)
  * [...]

According to this the export has to reflect that logic:
  * If an article is not shown in the shop, it is not exported.
  * If a variant is not shown in the shop, the respective attributes are not exported.
  * If a category is not show in the shop, the products only found in this category are not exported, the category itself is not exported as an attribute.
