====== Shop Backend Configuration ======

It is desireable that the module can be integrated into the shop via the shop's own plugin-system.

In the shop's backend for every language / subshop (shop-instance) a //shopkey//((is provided by FINDOLOGIC)) must be configurable and accessible for the module. It has to be made sure, that a shopkey can only be entered once (not for multiple shops). If an empty shopkey is entered and saved, FINDOLOGIC is deactivated for that shop.
