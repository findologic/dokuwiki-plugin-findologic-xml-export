# phpdokuwiki2findologic

This repository creates a XML export based on the dokuwiki data with the FINDOLOGIC XML scheme.\
It uses the library [libflexport](https://github.com/findologic/libflexport) to create the XML.\
Getting the data is some simple PHP stuff.
Note that there are no tests or anything else yet, so using it would be not that great of an idea.
